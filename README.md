#Rails for Business
===================

##Rails engine to run a small business or micro-isv type shop.

Idea is to have a repository that can be cloned, setup and then deployed (ie. Heroku, AWS, app engine)

Should include the following services
- email, webbased like gmail/yahoo clone
- cloud storage (utilizing free acounts alone (or in conjunction with each other) or S3, or owncloud, etc)
- user management
- home page?
- blog
- statistics / reports
- forum?


Repo is start of project
